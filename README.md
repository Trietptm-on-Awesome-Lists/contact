If you are worried about  authorities or the company you work reading your messages, you should take precautions. Here are a few ideas:

<b>MAIL</b>

Bradley Hope
WALL STREET JOURNAL, 7th Floor
1 London Bridge Street, London SE1 9GF
United Kingdom

<b>E-MAIL</b>

You can send me an encrypted e-mail using PGP at bradley.hope@wsj.com.

Encryption only protects the message itself, not the subject of the e-mail addresses of the people involved.

My key can be found here:

<b>CHAT MESSENGERS</b>

Signal is the gold-standard for encrypted messaging and phone calls. You can download it here: https://whispersystems.org/

You can add my mobile phone number to your contacts and I'll pop up as available. If you don't want to save my number, you can also send message through the system by typing my number into the search box and it will give you the option to click "New conversation with +447584600950."

Signal will keep a record of when you set up an account and what phone number you've used, which can be sensitive information.

Alternatively, you can use a program called Wickr, which lets you set up an account using only an e-mail address. 
You can create a fake e-mail address and use it to create an account, and then find me using my phone number or e-mail.
