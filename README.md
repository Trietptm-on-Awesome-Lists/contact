# contact

I am based in the London bureau of the Wall Street Journal.

If you have a tip about financial fraud, money-laundering or political corruption, or any sensitive topic,
you should be careful how you communicate with journalists about it.

<b>The basics:</b>
bradley.hope@wsj.com
Mobile: +447584600950
Office: +442078429208

<b>MAIL</b>

A simple, but effective, technique is to mail something the old-fashioned way. This is remarkably effective and relatively secure.

Just drop a letter in a post box addressed to:
Bradley Hope
WALL STREET JOURNAL, 7th Floor
1 London Bridge Street, London SE1 9GF
United Kingdom

<b>E-MAIL</b>

If you are using e-mail and you need to take precautions, you can send an encrypted message to me at bradley.hope@wsj.com using PGP. 

Be aware that encryption only protects the message itself, not the subject of the e-mail addresses of the people involved.

My key can be found here:

<b>CHAT MESSENGERS</b>

Signal is the gold-standard for encrypted messaging and phone calls. You can download it here: https://whispersystems.org/

You can then add my number (+447584600950) to your phone address book and message me. 

If it is extremely sensitive, you can send me a message through the system without adding my number to your address book. Just type my number into the search box and it will give you the option to click "New conversation with +447584600950."

Be aware that Signal will keep a record of when you set up an account and what phone number you've used, 
which can be sensitive information.

Alternatively, you can use a program called Wickr, which lets you set up an account using only an e-mail address. 
You can create a fake e-mail address and use it to create an account, and then find me using my phone number (+447584600950) 
or my e-mail (bradley.hope@wsj.com).
