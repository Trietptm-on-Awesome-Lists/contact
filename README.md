If you are worried about government authorities or the company you work reading your messages, you should take precautions. Here are a few ideas:

<b>MAIL</b>

A simple, but effective, technique is to mail something.

<b>E-MAIL</b>

You can send me an encrypted message using PGP at bradley.hope@wsj.com.

Encryption only protects the message itself, not the subject of the e-mail addresses of the people involved.

<b>CHAT MESSENGERS</b>

Signal is the gold-standard for encrypted messaging and phone calls. You can download it here: https://whispersystems.org/

You can add my mobile number to your phone address book and message me. 

If the subject is very sensitive, you can also send me a message through the system without adding my number to your address book. Just type my number into the search box and it will give you the option to click "New conversation with +447584600950."

Signal will keep a record of when you set up an account and what phone number you've used, which can be sensitive information.

Alternatively, you can use a program called Wickr, which lets you set up an account using only an e-mail address. 
You can create a fake e-mail address and use it to create an account, and then find me using my phone number or e-mail.
