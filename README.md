# contact

I am based in the London bureau of the Wall Street Journal.

If you have a tip about financial fraud, money-laundering or political corruption, or any sensitive topic,
you should be careful how you communicate with journalists about it.

<b>The basics:</b>
bradley.hope@wsj.com
Mobile: +447584600950
Office: +442078429208

<b>MAIL</b>

A simple, but effective, technique is to mail something the old-fashioned way. This is remarkably effective and relatively secure.

Just drop a letter in a post box addressed to:
Bradley Hope
WALL STREET JOURNAL, 7th Floor
1 London Bridge Street, London SE1 9GF
United Kingdom

<b>E-MAIL</b>

If you are using e-mail and you need to take precautions, you can send an encrypted message to me at bradley.hope@wsj.com using PGP. 

Be aware that encryption only protects the message itself, not the subject of the e-mail addresses of the people involved.

My key can be found here:

<b>CHAT MESSENGERS</b>

Signal is the gold-standard for encrypted messaging and phone calls. You can download it here: https://whispersystems.org/

You then have to add my phone number (+447584600950) to your phone address book. Then just message me.

Be aware that Signal will keep a record of when you set up an account and what phone number you've used, 
which can be sensitive information.

Alternatively, you can use a program called WickrMe, which lets you set up an account using only an e-mail address. 
You can create a fake e-mail address and use it to create an account, and then find me using my phone number (+447584600950) 
or my e-mail (bradley.hope@wsj.com).
