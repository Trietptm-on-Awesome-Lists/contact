If you are worried about authorities or the company you work for reading your messages, you should take precautions. Here are a few tactics:

<b>CHAT MESSENGERS</b>

Signal is the gold-standard for encrypted messaging and phone calls. You can download it here: https://whispersystems.org/

You can add my mobile phone number to your contacts and I'll pop up as available. If you don't want to save my number, you can also send message through the system by typing my number into the search box and it will give you the option to click "New conversation with +447584600950."

Signal will keep a record of when you set up an account and what phone number you've used, which can be sensitive information.

One shortcoming of Signal is that it's difficult to use without giving up your actual cell phone number, so another option is to use the secure messaging app called Wire: https://wire.com/en/. First create a quick e-mail address that doesn't include your name anywhere through a service like ProtonMail: https://protonmail.com/. 

Then, create an account online or through the desktop application using that e-mail address (don't register your phone number) and a pseudonymn. I can be found there via my e-mail or cell phone.

Another app that allows for a similar arrangement is WickrMe, which has a few security features that some people prefer. Wickr: https://www.wickr.com/

WhatsApp isn't bad either, but it has weaknesses. I don't recommend Telegram or text messages. 

<b>E-MAIL</b>

You can send me an encrypted e-mail using PGP at bradley.hope@wsj.com.

Encryption only protects the message itself, not the subject of the e-mail addresses of the people involved.
